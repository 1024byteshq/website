          1024 Bytes exists to help shape a more intentional and integrated
          internet; one where ideas are tested rigorously, systems are built to
          endure, and intelligence is embedded at the core of software.
        </p>

        <p className="text-black/80">
          We work with signal, not noise. Our focus is on building systems that
          are simple, powerful and useful whether they're internal tools,
          agentic infrastructures, or foundational codebases for real-world
          impact.
        </p>

        <p className="text-black/80">
          We collaborate with founders, researchers, and engineers who want to
          move beyond the demo and design software thatâ€™s resilient,
          context-aware, and future-facing.
        </p>

        <p className="text-black/80">
          Our mission is simple: build what matters, sharpen what exists, and
          help technical ideas grow into long-term value; one system, one
          insight, one byte at a time.
